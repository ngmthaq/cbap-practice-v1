Treating each incident involves many employees from different departments extensively collaborating and exchanging information. That information is spread across multiple systems having their access limited to particular user groups. With the current manual process, some incidents get forgotten and remain unresolved for years. The project's Sponsor is an Equipment Integrity and Reliability Advisor, who moved into this position from another business unit.

Having a positive experience with the application, the Sponsor is suggesting to customize it and reuse in the new business unit. The business unit's Enterprise Architect (EA), who is responsible for assessing solution options and presenting them to executive decision makers, has a few concerns with adopting the existing application. The application uses point-to-point interfaces with other data sources whereas the business unit's target architecture relies on a data warehouse-based integration. Moreover, the two business units use different legacy systems, as well as different front-end implementation technologies. Additionally, the existing application is monolingual, while the business unit needs user interfaces and some data to be presented in two languages. With all of this, it may be easier to build a new application from scratch than to customize the existing one.

The distributor performs well overall, but is repeatedly unable to keep up with ful lling many customer orders during peak demand periods. The distributor's current delivery capability is stretched to deliver 60 tons of merchandise per day whereas the season's peak demand periods need a daily delivery capability of up to 100 tons. The distributor is under pressure to fully meet the year-round market demand in order to stay in business. The distributor's management wants to identify and consider more cost-effective options as resorting to adding more trucks and drivers would not be economically feasible. A business analyst (BA) has spent several days observing and measuring the warehouse activities to understand the situation and to gain insights into possible solutions. The delivery work ow is a four-step process: (1) picking the orders and assembling them on trays, (2) bringing the trays to the loading bay, (3) loading the orders into trucks, and (4) delivering the orders to customers. As the following table illustrates, overall performance depends is dependent on ve major resources: (1) the workers who pick the orders and load them into trucks, (2) the tallyers who check the orders, (3) the drivers, (4) the trucks, and (5) eight loading bays (LBs).What is the company's primary business objective in this scenario?",

The purpose of the site is to help their customers manage their exposures and ideally prevent them from having claims. There were 100 customers that were part of the Pilot that represented 25 different industries. The business goals were to increase use of the site and provide tools to help customer awareness of their exposures, so that they may reduce existing exposures and ultimately reduce claims. The sites Features were as follows:  \n- Improvements to the search engine to all customers to search for articles, tools and services on the site.  \n- A checklist function that allow customer to create their own unique Checklists or utilize a sample provided by ABC company to use daily,weekly etc for an area of their facility.  \n- A promotion feature \"\" where Risk preventing Articles, and tools on the site are marketed toward a customer.  \n- A pro le section allowing for Customer Name, Address and contact Phone number.After the 12 months pilot, the business sponsor received an assessment of what was working and what was not. The Assessment of the pilot revealed overall site activity had signi cantly increased, however only 5% of the time the promotions were viewed. And the most shocking was that total claims increased by nearly 20% for these 100 customers during the pilot period. The business sponsor was perplexed as he had an expectation of reduced claims and at least for 30% viewing of promotions since the project team had spend a lot of careful time and effort on this feature. A BA was assigned to do further analysis regarding the low use of the promotions and why claims were not being reduced. Regarding the use of promotion the BA looked into other similar companies to see what they did differently to get their customer to look at their promotions. The BA found that similar companies had promotions that targeted the industry the customer was in so it was more relevant to them and they were more interested to view the promotion. In addition the BA sent out survey to all 100 pilot customers asking probing questions about what they thought of the site and if they felt it had decreased their exposure to risk su ciently. The Survey responses came back with raving positive comments and providing examples of how the site had been helping in the reduction of claims from the customer's perspective. In addition the survey also revealed insight that the customers found the promotion often irrelevant to their industry. The BA asked for a dump of all documentation of the 100 claims that were led over the 12 month pilot period. The BA found the nearly 90% of the claim eld were all in one region of the country and were all for property damage related to several severe winter storms in the region and the claims were nearly all unavoidable by the customers. The BA brought all this analysis back to the business sponsor and made the recommendation to the business sponsor to require the customer to select 1 of 25 industries in their pro le. This would in turn allow for the ability to show industry speci c promotions and promote search results relative to a customer's industry to be stored at the top giving the customer a more personalized experience.

The Survey responses came back with raving positive comments and providing examples of how the site had been helping in the reduction of claims from the customer's perspective. In addition the survey also revealed insight that the customers found the promotion often irrelevant to their industry.

The BA found the nearly 90% of the claim eld were all in one region of the country and were all for property damage related to several severe winter storms in the region and the claims were nearly all unavoidable by the customers. The BA brought all this analysis back to the business sponsor and made the recommendation to the business sponsor to require the customer to select 1 of 25 industries in their pro le. This would in turn allow for the ability to show industry speci c promotions and promote search results relative to a customer's industry to be stored at the top giving the customer a more personalized experience.

  "quesText": "A very large insurer of General Liability and Property Damage insurance has an upward trend of increased claims over the past 5 years. The Risk Control Area for that company has just completed a 12 month Pilot of a new improved Risk Control Site. The purpose of the site is to help their customers manage their exposures and ideally prevent them from having claims. There were 100 customers that were part of the Pilot that represented 25 different industries. The business goals were to increase use of the site and provide tools to help customer awareness of their exposures, so that they may reduce existing exposures and ultimately reduce claims. The sites Features were as follows:  \n- Improvements to the search engine to all customers to search for articles, tools and services on the site.  \n- A checklist function that allow customer to create their own unique Checklists or utilize a sample provided by ABC company to use daily,weekly etc for an area of their facility.  \n- A promotion feature \"\" where Risk preventing Articles, and tools on the site are marketed toward a customer.  \n- A pro le section allowing for Customer Name, Address and contact Phone number.After the 12 months pilot, the business sponsor received an assessment of what was working and what was not. The Assessment of the pilot revealed overall site activity had signi cantly increased, however only 5% of the time the promotions were viewed. And the most shocking was that total claims increased by nearly 20% for these 100 customers during the pilot period. The business sponsor was perplexed as he had an expectation of reduced claims and at least for 30% viewing of promotions since the project team had spend a lot of careful time and effort on this feature. A BA was assigned to do further analysis regarding the low use of the promotions and why claims were not being reduced. Regarding the use of promotion the BA looked into other similar companies to see what they did differently to get their customer to look at their promotions. The BA found that similar companies had promotions that targeted the industry the customer was in so it was more relevant to them and they were more interested to view the promotion. In addition the BA sent out survey to all 100 pilot customers asking probing questions about what they thought of the site and if they felt it had decreased their exposure to risk su ciently.

Due to aggressive market competition, the management of the company performed a strategy review and based on their ndings and the current market conditions they came up with strategic and tactical changes in order to keep a competitive market position. In order to strengthen customer retention strategies through a new competitive advantage, the company is considering implementing a live parcel tracking system. The added value will be that the customers may determine the exact location of the parcel whether it is in a warehouse, crossing the ocean through an overseas ship, or travelling in a delivery truck at any time. The system tracks the location of the parcel by tracking the vehicle in which it is contained. However, for a group of old delivery trucks, it was noticed that the engine sound and vibration disturbed the tracking signal and caused interruptions. Therefore, the tracking does not perform accurately on these vehicles. Although the majority of management would like to sell these vehicles and replace them with newer ones, the Chief Financial O cer (CFO) was strongly against that approach. The CFO argued that instead of hanging tracking devices on the trucks' body, they can have the truck drivers manually send the truck location from a hand held mobile device every 30 minutes. The company has a total of 134 old delivery trucks that have been in service for 10 years. Each vehicle was bought at a price of $22,000.

Another area of tactical improvement for the courier company is pricing. The management strongly believes that they can start a price war with the most aggressive competitor. Management thinks, with their variable cost of $4 per parcel and xed cost of $6 per parcel, they can win the market.
